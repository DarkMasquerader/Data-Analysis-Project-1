## Business Problem 
A hypothetical game development studio looking to develop a game for the PC platform is considered for this project.

The studio would like to know what types of games are most successful, providing the studio with the means to develop a game with the highest chance of success.

<!-- This project answers this question by generating a novel, large-scale dataset (first-hand) concerning the games available on the Steam platform and subsequently conducting an analysis. -->

## Tech Stack 
- [Python](Python%20Files/)
    - Data Acquisition: Website Scraping, Website Automation, Multi-Threading 
    - Data Processing: Data Transformation & Handling (Pandas)
    - Data Visualisation: Numpy, Matplotlib
- [Tableau](Tableau/)

## Project Focus 
This project covers all stages of the data analysis process, with the strong points of this project being the *data collection* and *data processing* stages.

In-depth details on these stages can be found in the [Python](Python%20Files/) directory.

## Data Preparation and Acquisition
The dataset used in the analysis is generated by scraping data data from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and [SteamCharts](https://steamcharts.com/).

The collected data is also cleaned and transformed in preparation for subsequent data analysis.

The script responsible for data acquisition and preparation is `Data Acquisition.py`, which can be found [here](Python%20Files/Data%20Acquisition/), alongside more in-depth technical details.

## Explore the Notebook
The Jupyter notebook used to facilitate data analysis is provided [here](Python%20Files/Jupyter%20Notebook/My_Notebook.ipynb).

The notebook has been designed to be as dynamic and interactive as possible, adjusting figures and data structures to accommodate changes in the controllable variables.

## Explore the Dashboard (Tableau) 
An interactive Tableau dashboard has been implemented to present the findings of this research project, with the limited publicly available data.

For further details and to view the dashboard, go to the [Tableau](Tableau/) directory.

## Insights and Recommendations
Based on the findings of the analysis, the recommendation for the game studio is to develop an action-based multiplayer game due to such games being consistently high-ranking. 

<!-- Based on the findings of this brief analysis, the recommendation of the type of game for the game studio to create to have the highest chance of being successful (determined by active player count) is an action-based multiplayer game. -->
Concerning the payment model and pricing, a lower price is suggested due to the negative correlation between price and game popularity.

## Project Challenges and Limitations

### Data Availability & Bias
A significant challenge faced by this project is the availability of data.

Key information that would enable an accurate, in-depth exploration into this research question (e.g. revenue, purchase numbers, and in-game purchase information) is not publicly available, with such information likely being kept as business secrets of the game studios and platforms.

As a result, this led to using a criterion for determining success that is biased in favour of multiplayer games: player count (average and current).

This approach to determining the success of a game is biased in favour of multiplayer games due to such games being designed to retain a consistent player base, and their inability to be 'completed'.
Single-player games, on the other hand, typically have a clear end goal with the ability to be 'completed', at which point the game stops being played.

### Data Collection Challenges
The main nature of the challenges faced during data collection is 'unexpected variations' in the pages of the games on Steam.

Though not difficult to address, this greatly increased the development time and complexity of the script.
