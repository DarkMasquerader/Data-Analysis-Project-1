## Business Problem 
A game development company wants to make a new game for the PC platform, but before starting development, the company would like to know the answer to the following question: 'What type of games are most successful?'.

This work answers this question by generating a novel, large-scale dataset concerning the games on the Steam platform. 

This program and dataset is made available to the public for further use.

## Data Preparation and Acquisition
The dataset used for this project is generated using data from Steam[] and SteamCharts[], using *web scraping* and *website automation* alongside advanced programming techniques such as multi-threading and resource management (mutexes).

The collected data was also cleaned and transformed in preparation for subsequent data analysis.

## Notable Techniques  
**NOTE:** Teachnical techniques are appended with an asterisk 
- Bivariate data analsys 
- Regression 

- Website scraping *
- Website automation (aka. botting) *
- Multi-threading and resource management *

## Tech Stack
